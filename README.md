# Blanket

Blanket is an interface to the Picnic development commands, implemented
as an Emacs package.

## What is a blanket doing at a picnic?
Either it is a romantic picnic or family picnic, we need something to
sit on and picnic blacket is the best option for that. Otherwise,
people can choose to stand or sit on the grass.

## Installation
It is not available on MELPA so you would have to do something like
this in your Emacs init file:

```
(load-file "<PATH_TO_THIS_REPO>/blanket.el")
```

## Documentation
To try Blanket, just call <kbd>M-x</kbd> `blanket`. This will show the top
level menu for Picnic commands.
