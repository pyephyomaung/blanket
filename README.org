Blanket is an interface to the Picnic development commands, implemented
as an Emacs package.

* What is Blanket?
  Either it is a romantic picnic or family picnic, we need something
  to sit on and be productive and picnic blacket is the best option
  for that. Otherwise, people can choose to stand or sit on the grass.

* Getting started
  Firstly, you would need to get your user name and access token from Gitlab settings. Then, set environment variables (eg. in ~/.bash_profile for OSX)
  #+begin_src bash
    export GITLAB_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
    export GITLAB_USERNAME=<YOUR_USER>
  #+end_src

  It is not available on MELPA so you would have to do something like
  this in your Emacs init file:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "GITLAB_TOKEN")
  (exec-path-from-shell-copy-env "GITLAB_USERNAME")
  (load-file "<PATH_TO_THIS_REPO>/blanket.el")
  #+end_src```

  To try Blanket, just call ~M-x~ ~blanket~. This will show the top
  level menu for Picnic commands.
